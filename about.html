        <p>Red Cross Junior App (c) nonprofit, independent, community blood center, founded in 1974 as Mississippi Valley Regional Blood Center in Davenport, Iowa. Over the years, we have extended into Illinois, Missouri, and Wisconsin, and in 2021, we united under one new name: ImpactLife. This evolution allowed us to bring the organization together under a unified identity that truly embraces our mission. 

            ImpactLife provides lifesaving blood products to more than 120 hospitals and emergency medical service providers in a four-state region. Weâ€™re headquartered in Davenport, Iowa, and have distribution hubs and donor centers in Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Wisconsin.  
            
            Every year, we team up with thousands of blood donors and hundreds of community partners to help save lives through blood drives.
